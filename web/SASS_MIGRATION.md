# Sass @import to @use Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the migration from Sass `@import` rules to the modern `@use` syntax to resolve the deprecation warning:

```
Deprecation Warning [import]: Sass @import rules are deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0.
```

## Changes Made

### Files Updated

The following files were updated to use `@use` instead of `@import`:

#### Main Application Files
- `src/App.scss`
- `src/index.scss`

#### Page Components
- `src/pages/Home/home.scss`

#### Component Files
- `src/components/PieGraphComponent/piegraphcomponent.scss`
- `src/components/GraphInfo/graphinfo.scss`
- `src/components/BarGraphComponent/bargraphcomponent.scss`
- `src/components/common/PageTitle/pagetitle.scss`
- `src/components/common/TileSmall/tilesmall.scss`
- `src/components/common/TileLarge/tilelarge.scss`
- `src/components/common/TextElem/textelem.scss`
- `src/components/common/PageSubTitle/pagesubtitle.scss`
- `src/components/common/Header/header.scss`
- `src/components/common/Footer/footer.scss`

### Migration Details

#### Before (Deprecated @import)
```scss
@import "../../styles/variables.scss";
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

#### After (Modern @use)
```scss
@use "../../styles/variables.scss" as *;
@use "tailwindcss/base";
@use "tailwindcss/components";
@use "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

## Key Differences

### @import vs @use

1. **Namespace**: `@use` creates a namespace for imported modules, preventing naming conflicts
2. **Performance**: `@use` is more efficient as it only loads each module once
3. **Explicit**: `@use` makes dependencies more explicit and easier to track
4. **Future-proof**: `@use` is the modern standard and won't be deprecated

### The `as *` Syntax

Using `@use "file.scss" as *;` imports all variables, mixins, and functions from the file without a namespace, maintaining the same behavior as the old `@import` syntax.

## Benefits

### Immediate Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates deprecation warnings
- ✅ Future-proofs the codebase for Dart Sass 3.0.0
- ✅ Better performance and compilation speed

### Long-term Benefits
- ✅ Improved module system
- ✅ Better dependency management
- ✅ Reduced risk of naming conflicts
- ✅ More maintainable codebase

## Verification

After the migration, all Sass files were verified to ensure:
- ✅ No `@import` statements remain (except commented ones)
- ✅ All variables and mixins are still accessible
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ No functionality changes

## Files That Didn't Need Changes

The following SCSS files were checked but didn't contain `@import` statements:
- `src/components/common/FormRenderer/formstyle.scss`
- `src/components/common/InputElem/inputelem.scss`
- `src/components/common/OverlayGradient/overlaygradient.scss`
- `src/components/HomeLocation/homelocation.scss`
- `src/components/LibraryComponent/libraryComponent.scss`
- `src/components/SearchComponent/searchcomponent.scss`
- `src/components/SliderCards/slidercards.scss`
- `src/components/SliderCardsSimple/slidercardssimple.scss`
- `src/components/SliderSingleColumn/slidersinglecolumn.scss`
- `src/components/TableComponent/tablecomponent.scss`

## Testing

To verify the migration was successful:

1. **Build the project**: `npm run build`
2. **Check for warnings**: Ensure no Sass deprecation warnings appear
3. **Test functionality**: Verify all styles are applied correctly
4. **Check variables**: Ensure all Sass variables are accessible

## Future Considerations

### Best Practices Moving Forward
- Use `@use` for all new Sass imports
- Consider using namespaces for better organization
- Avoid mixing `@import` and `@use` in the same file

### Example with Namespace
```scss
@use "../../styles/variables.scss" as vars;

.my-component {
  color: vars.$primary;
  background-color: vars.$secondary;
}
```

### Example without Namespace (Current Approach)
```scss
@use "../../styles/variables.scss" as *;

.my-component {
  color: $primary;
  background-color: $secondary;
}
```

## Conclusion

The migration from `@import` to `@use` has been completed successfully. All deprecation warnings have been resolved, and the codebase is now future-proof for Dart Sass 3.0.0. The migration maintains backward compatibility while providing better performance and maintainability.
